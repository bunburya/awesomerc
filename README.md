This is my custom configuration for AwesomeWM v4.3 (running on ArchLinux on a Dell Latitude 5520).

The main structural change as against the default configuration is that I have separated it out into multiple files, which are simply imported in the main `rc.lua`. I have also included some custom keybindings, rules, widgets, etc.
